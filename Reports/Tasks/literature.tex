\section{The Dutch measurement system}
Traffic information, together with information regarding the measurement system installed on the network was retrieved from the NDW, the \textit{National Data Warehouse for Traffic Information} \cite{ndw}. The sensor array consists of approximately 60,000 sensors spread throughout the Dutch roads and highways.
